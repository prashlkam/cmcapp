 Cursor control software - objective / approach 
--------------------------------------------------

basic approach to be followed from here - could be something like this..........

 * change the cursor theme - the cursor should be changed system wide [we can do this later] 
 * When Cursor control module is activated - it should do the following.......
   -> enter a continuous loop
   -> keep track of 3 valuables 
	a) a bool named 'firstclick'
	b) a Timer with interval of something like 1000ms
	c) an int [values ranging from  1 to 9]
   -> get mouse input inside the timer method [for every tick] 
   -> increment the int for every tick [1 to 9 and then start over from 1]
   -> change value of bool var 'firstclick' for every left click of the mouse [toggle between true and false]
   -> have a switch case block based on the value of the int var

now based on the value of firstclick there are two possibilities..........

		true									 	false 


freeze the animated cursor [if possible]

if int val >=2 && <=5 - move the cursor 		stop the cursor 

toggle value of the bool var				toggle value of the bool var

if int var > 5 - send mouse input			switch to animated cursor theme


logic for switch case block..........
cases:
	1) do nothing / [drop] / stop
	2) move cursor up
	3) move cursor right
	4) move cursor down
	5) move cursor left
	6) send left click
	7) send double click
	8) start drag action [ exec a sub branch ]
	9) send right click

logic for drag [sub branch]..........
cases:
	1) Start Drag [no direction]
	2) Drag Up
	3) Drag right
	4) Drag down
	5) Drag left
	6) Drop / release
